## Project Overview

This is a Preact application built with Vite, using TypeScript. It features a simple counter component and is configured for testing with Vitest and deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Architecture

- **Main Component**: `src/app.tsx` - The App component with state management using Preact hooks (e.g., `useState` for counter).
- **Entry Point**: `src/main.tsx` - Renders the App component to the DOM element with id 'app'.
- **Assets**: `src/assets/` - Static assets like SVG logos imported in components.
- **Build Output**: `dist/` - Generated by Vite build, served from this directory.
- **Base URL**: Dynamically set in `vite.config.ts` using `process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY` to support GitHub Pages subpaths (e.g., `/${repo-name}/` in CI, `/` locally).

## Key Workflows

- **Development**: `npm run dev` starts Vite dev server with hot module replacement (HMR) for fast iteration.
- **Build**: `npm run build` runs TypeScript compilation (`tsc -b`) followed by Vite bundling.
- **Test**: `npm run test` executes Vitest tests once (non-watch mode), generating JUnit XML report at `junit.xml`.
- **Preview**: `npm run preview` serves the built app locally for verification.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline with sequential jobs: 'test' (runs tests and uploads JUnit), 'build' (depends on test, builds and uploads dist), 'deploy' (depends on build, publishes to Pages).

## Conventions

- **Testing**: Place tests in `src/__tests__/`, use `@testing-library/preact` for component testing with jsdom environment. Example: `src/__tests__/App.test.tsx` checks for "Vite + Preact" text.
- **Configuration**: Separate `vitest.config.ts` for test settings (globals, environment, JUnit reporter).
- **Base Path Handling**: Always check `process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY` for dynamic base to ensure correct asset paths in Pages deployment.
- **Artifacts**: Test results saved as `junit.xml` artifact, build as `dist/` artifact for deployment.

## Dependencies & Integrations

- **Preact**: Used for lightweight component rendering with hooks.
- **Vite**: Handles bundling, dev server, and build; configured with Preact preset.
- **Vitest**: Integrated testing with JUnit output for CI reporting.
- **GitHub Pages**: Deployment target; workflow uses actions for Pages setup and upload.
